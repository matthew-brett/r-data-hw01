This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you
execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

*Please don't delete any comments in the R chunks  These are the lines
beginning with `#`.  We will use the comments when we do the marking, which we
do by running the code and checking the output, with an automated script.  If
you delete the comments, we won't be to tell which chunk is running, and we
can't give you the marks*.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by
placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.


```{r}
# A little calculation, to warm up.
42 * 2
```

As you probably know by now, you can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert
Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be
saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to
preview the HTML file).

In this Notebook, we will ask you to "show" some values.  For example, imagine
you had already set a variable `a` to contain the value 10:

```{r}
a <- 10
```

To "show"" the value, you put the variable on a line on its own, at the end of
the chunk, like this:

```{r}
a
```

When you execute the chunk, the value appears after the chunk.

## Introducing the data

The Notebook uses the same data that you have already seen in the [R
from scratch](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-from-scratch)
tutorial.

As you may remember from the tutorial, this dataset is a subset of a
larger dataset from the World Bank on gender and inequality:
<https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics>.

The subset is a selection of variables for every country. For each variable, we
have taken the mean of all available values from 2012 through 2016.  If you're
very interested, the data processing is in [this web
directory](https://github.com/matthew-brett/datasets/tree/master/gender_stats).

As in the tutorial, we need to load the file into memory, as an R
*data frame*:

```{r}
gender_data <- read.csv('gender_stats_data.csv')
```

After executing the chunk above, you should have a new variable called
`gender_data`, of type *data frame*.

If you want to get a spreadsheet view of the data, you can use the `View` function, as in the chunk below.

The view will open in a new tab.  Switch back to this Notebook tab to
continue:

```{r}
View(gender_data)
```

When you look at the `View` of the data frame, you will see that it
has the column names that you know from the tutorial.  You can see all
the column names with:

```{r}
names(gender_data)
```

Here are the column names with a brief description of what they mean:

* `fert_rate`: Fertility rate, total (births per woman).
* `gdp`: GDP (current US\$).
* `health_exp_per_cap`: Health expenditure per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international \$).
* `health_exp_pub`: Health expenditure, public (% of GDP).
* `prim_ed_girls`: Primary education, pupils (% female).
* `mat_mort_ratio`: Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births).
* `population`: Population, total.

## Exploring the data

Our hypothesis is that there may be some relationship between the
amount of public money that a country spends on health
(`health_exp_pub`), and the maternal mortality ratio
(`mat_mort_ratio`).

Because you are now have some training in data analysis, you want to
explore the data first.

A first step is to look at the distributions of the values for each
column, using histograms.

First show the histogram for the `health_exp_pub` column:

```{r}
#- Type the command to show a histogram of the 'health_exp_pub' column of
#- the 'gender_data' data frame.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 10 so far).
```

Next show the histogram for the `mat_mort_ratio` column:

```{r}
#- Type the command to show a histogram of the 'mat_mort_ratio' column of
#- the 'gender_data' data frame.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 15 so far).
```

Use the `median` function to show that the default median value for
`health_exp_pub` is `NA` (Not Available):

```{r}
#- Use the 'median' function to show that the median value for the
#- `health_exp_pub` column of 'gender_data' is NA
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 20 so far).
```

This NA value means that one or more of the `health_exp_pub` values are NA.

Remember your "R from scratch" reading, and repeat the median calculation, but
dropping the NA values:

```{r}
#- Type the command to show the median value for the
#- `health_exp_pub` column, after removing the NA values.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 30 so far).
```

Show the median value for the `mat_mort_ratio` column, after dropping
the NA values:

```{r}
#- Type the command to show the median value for the
#- `mat_mort_ratio` column, after removing the NA values.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 35 so far).
```

## Plotting the variables

Plot the `health_exp_pub` column against the `mat_mort_ratio` column.
The data from the `health_exp_pub` column should be on the x axis, and
the data from the `mat_mort_ratio` column should be on the y axis.

```{r}
#- Type the commands to plot values in the 'health_exp_pub' column
#- against the `mat_mort_ratio` values.
#- 15 marks / 100 (total 50 so far).
```

## Calculating public health expenditure per person

Have a look at the definition of `health_exp_pub` above - it is public health
expenditure as a percentage of the country's [Gross Domestic
Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) (GDP).

Maybe that is not a good measure to use, to predict maternal mortality.  Maybe
the key measure is not the percentage of the GDP spent on health, but the
public dollars spent per person (per capita).

You need to calculate this number, for each row (and therefore, each country).

Start by dividing `health_exp_pub` by 100, to get public health expenditure as
a *proportion* of GDP.  The chunk below makes a new variable, where every
element in the `health_exp_pub` column has been divided by 100. Run it to get
the new variable:

```{r}
# Calculate public health expenditure as proportion of GDP
# Run this chunk to create the variable.
health_exp_pub_prop <- gender_data$health_exp_pub / 100
```

You can check this calculation by showing the median of the
`health_exp_pub_prop` variable, after removing the `NA` values.  It should be
same as the median of the `health_exp_pub` column above, but divided by 100.

```{r}
#- Type the command to show the median value for the
#- `health_exp_pub_prop` variable, after removing the NA values.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 55 so far).
```

Next, make a new variable called `health_exp_pub_total`, by multiplying the
values in your `health_exp_pub_prop` variable by the values in the `gdp` column
of `gender_data`.  This gives you the total public health expenditure.

```{r}
#- Create a new variable 'health_exp_pub_total' that contains the
#- `health_exp_pub_prop` variable multiplied by the 'gdp' column of
#- 'gender_data'.
#- Your code will start with 'health_exp_pub_total <-'
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 65 so far).
```

Finally, make another new variable, `health_exp_pub_per_cap`, that contains the
result of dividing the values in `health_exp_pub_total` by the values in the
`population` column of `gender_data`.  This is the public health expenditure
per person (per _capita_), in dollars.

```{r}
#- Create a new variable 'health_exp_pub_per_cap' that contains the
#- `health_exp_pub_total` variable divided by the 'population' column of
#- 'gender_data'.
#- Your code will start with 'health_exp_pub_per_cap <-'
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 75 so far).
```

Show a histogram of the values in `health_exp_pub_per_cap`:

```{r}
#- Show a histogram of the values in 'health_exp_pub_per_cap`.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 85 so far).
```

Show the median of the values in `health_exp_pub_per_cap`, with the `NA` values removed:

```{r}
#- Show the median of the values in 'health_exp_pub_per_cap`, after removing
#- the NA values.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 90 so far).
```

Plot the `health_exp_pub_per_cap` values against the values in the
`mat_mort_ratio` column of `gender_data`.  The `health_exp_pub_per_cap` values
go on the x axis, and the `mat_mort_ratio` values go on the y axis.

```{r}
#- Plot 'health_exp_pub_per_cap' against `mat_mort_ratio`.
#- 10 marks / 100 (total 100 so far).
```

## Before you submit

Before you submit this Notebook for marking, make sure that all the chunks
execute correctly.  To do that, go to the Run button at the top of the
notebook, and click "Restart R and Clear Output".  Then go to the top of the
notebook, and run each chunk in turn, to make sure that they run without error,
and give you the output you expect.  *Remember, we're going to run an automated
marking script over this file, so it has to execute correctly, for you to get
the marks*.
